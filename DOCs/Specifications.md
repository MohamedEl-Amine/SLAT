# Project Specification

**Project Name:** Secure Local Attendance Terminal (SLAT)
**Type:** Internal system – fixed scope
**Deployment:** Single laptop, offline

---

## 1. Purpose

Provide a **secure, traceable, and controlled attendance system** with **admin control**, **multiple identification methods**, and **time-window enforcement**, without evolving into an enterprise HR platform.

---

## 2. Roles

### 2.1 Employee

Can only:

* Identify themselves
* Register attendance (IN / OUT)

Cannot:

* View logs
* Modify data
* Change settings

### 2.2 Administrator

Can:

* Manage employees
* Configure attendance rules
* View and export logs
* Enable/disable identification methods

Cannot:

* Edit or delete attendance records

---

## 3. Identification Methods (Configurable)

The system supports **multiple methods**, selectable per employee.
At least **one** must be enabled.

### 3.1 Card / ID Number (Mandatory Baseline)

* Numeric or alphanumeric ID
* Entered manually or via USB card reader (acts as keyboard)

### 3.2 QR Code (Optional)

* Unique QR per employee
* Generated by admin
* Scanned via laptop camera

### 3.3 Face Recognition (Optional – Controlled)

* 1 face template per employee
* Used only for identity verification
* No emotion, age, or behavior analysis
* Local processing only
* Fallback to ID/PIN always required

**Explicit Limits**

* No cloud model
* No continuous camera feed
* No face tracking
* No cross-device recognition

---

## 4. Authentication Rules

* Each attendance action requires:

  * One identification method
  * Optional PIN (admin configurable)
* Face recognition **cannot be the only factor**

---

## 5. Attendance Logic

### 5.1 Actions

* Check In
* Check Out

### 5.2 Time Windows (Admin-Defined)

Admin can configure:

* Morning attendance window (e.g. 08:00–09:00)
* Afternoon attendance window (e.g. 13:00–14:00)

Rules:

* Outside allowed windows → attendance rejected
* Window rules applied per day
* No grace period logic (hard cutoff)

---

## 6. Functional Features

### 6.1 Attendance Recording

Each record includes:

* Employee ID
* Timestamp
* Action (IN / OUT)
* Identification method used
* Device identifier
* Optional photo snapshot
* Integrity hash

---

### 6.2 Employee Management

Admin can:

* Add employee
* Assign ID / QR / Face
* Enable or disable employee
* Reset PIN

Restrictions:

* No deletion if logs exist
* No bulk import

---

### 6.3 Face Data Management

* Face enrollment done in admin mode
* Single capture session
* Data stored locally
* Can be revoked and re-enrolled

---

## 7. Admin Mode

### Access

* Password protected
* Accessible via hidden key combination

### Capabilities

* Employee management
* Time window configuration
* Identification method configuration
* Log viewing (read-only)
* Export logs

---

## 8. User Interface

### Public Mode

* Fullscreen
* Simple prompt
* Automatic return to idle state
* Clear rejection message if outside time window

### Admin Mode

* Form-based screens
* No inline editing of logs
* Confirmation required for rule changes

---

## 9. Security & Integrity

* All data stored locally
* Attendance logs are append-only
* Hash-chained records
* Face data encrypted at rest
* No network access required

---

## 10. Failure Handling

| Scenario                     | Result             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Face recognition fails       | Fallback to ID/PIN |
| Camera unavailable           | ID/PIN still works |
| Attempt outside allowed time | Rejected           |
| Duplicate attendance         | Logged as-is       |
| Power loss                   | No data corruption |

---

## 11. Explicit Non-Features (Hard Limits)

The system will **not**:

* Calculate work hours
* Handle lateness penalties
* Auto-correct mistakes
* Sync to cloud
* Support multiple devices
* Generate analytics
* Integrate payroll or HR
* Use mobile phones
* Use external biometric services

---

## 12. Technology Constraints

* Desktop application
* PyQt5
* Offline-only
* Single device
* Local storage only

---

## 13. Project Closure Rule

The project is complete when:

* Admin mode works
* Multiple identification methods work
* Time windows are enforced
* Logs are immutable and exportable

Any request beyond this scope requires a **new project approval**.
