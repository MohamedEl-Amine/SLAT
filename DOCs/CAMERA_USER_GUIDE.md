# 📷 Camera Usage Guide - SLAT Terminal

## Quick Reference

### When Can I Use the Camera?

The camera is **only available during working hours**:
- **Morning Window**: Arrival time (check with admin)
- **Afternoon Window**: Departure time (check with admin)

Outside these hours, the camera is **automatically disabled** for security and privacy.

### How to Activate the Camera

1. **Check the screen** - You'll see instructions if the camera is available
2. **Press SPACE or ENTER** on the keyboard
3. **Camera will activate** and show a countdown timer
4. **Present your QR code** or **look at the camera** (depending on mode)

### What Does the Timer Mean?

The timer shows how long the camera will stay active:

| Display | Meaning | Color |
|---------|---------|-------|
| ✓ Session: 02:00 | Camera will stay on for 2 more minutes | 🟢 Green |
| ⚠ Session: 00:45 | Less than 1 minute remaining | 🟠 Orange |
| ⏰ Session: 00:15 | Less than 30 seconds remaining! | 🔴 Red |

### Session Extension (Automatic)

**Good news!** Each successful scan automatically extends the timer by 2 more minutes.

**Example:**
- You scan your QR → Timer resets to 02:00
- Your colleague scans → Timer resets to 02:00 again
- Another person scans → Timer resets to 02:00 again
- This continues as long as people keep scanning

**This means:** Multiple people can use the same camera session without reactivating!

### What Happens When Timer Expires?

If 2 minutes pass with no scans:
- Camera **automatically closes**
- Screen shows: "⏱️ Session caméra expirée"
- To use camera again: **Press SPACE or ENTER**

### Outside Working Hours

If you try to activate the camera outside working hours:
- You'll see: "⏰ Caméra désactivée en dehors des fenêtres horaires"
- Working hours will be displayed on screen
- You must use **Card ID mode** instead (if available)

### Troubleshooting

#### Camera Won't Activate
1. Check if you're within working hours
2. Make sure you're in QR or Face mode (not Card ID mode)
3. Try pressing SPACE or ENTER again
4. If error persists, switch to Card ID mode (press TAB)

#### Timer Keeps Expiring Too Fast
- The 2-minute timer is working correctly
- After each scan, it automatically resets to 2:00
- If camera closes, just press SPACE to reactivate

#### Camera Activated But Not Scanning
- Make sure to present QR code clearly
- For face mode, look directly at camera
- Wait for recognition (there's a 3-second cooldown between scans)
- Check the countdown timer - if it shows red, camera may close soon

### Privacy & Security

✅ Camera is **never active** outside working hours
✅ Camera requires **manual activation** (SPACE/ENTER)
✅ Camera **auto-closes** after 2 minutes of inactivity
✅ You have **full visibility** of camera status (countdown timer)

### Key Combinations

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **SPACE** or **ENTER** | Activate camera |
| **TAB** | Switch between methods (QR / Face / Card) |
| **F11** (5 times) | Admin access (password protected) |
